**4. How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?** <br>
The redlining map shows discrimination. It shows that segregated areas lead to stark economic disparities between races. Redlining map of Detroit is also subject to potential misunderstandings. Using color-coded zones oversimplifies reality, forcing blacks in red zones to have the same experiences and thus to be rejected by lending banks with equal probability.

**5. How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?** <br>
The redlining map marked illustrates a city characterized by systemic racial disparities. Black in communities are relegated to redlined areas, classified as high-risk investment zones, and are often denied loans by financial institutions.

This power influenced the economic gap between blacks and whites to become wider and wider.
